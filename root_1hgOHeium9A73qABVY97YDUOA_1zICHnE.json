    "description": "This show follows a middle-class family of five, each with their own distinct personality. In the context of their comfortable daily lives, they experience countless lighthearted and amusing scenarios. The father is a typical \"macho man\", while the mother works hard behind the scenes to raise their two sons. The eldest son is a middle manager who often plays the \"peacemaker\" role in his career, family and relationships, due to his fear of confrontation. His wife is a strong-willed insurance broker who cares deeply for her husband, but can also be overbearing at times. The youngest son is a capable young man who is lost when it comes to love.  The show also features the family's neighbors, friends, and colleagues, each with their own distinct personality, and their interactions and relationships produce many heartwarming stories.",
